                    <h1>Is total control really inevitable?</h1>
                    <p> 
                        To survive, it is necessary to promptly notice the threats that already exist and those that are just emerging.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Are we able to weigh the likelihood of changing trends in social systems and see that societies are moving towards complete control and regulation of individual life?                   
                    </p>    
                    <p>
                        Or is this an incorrect assessment?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The level of complexity of social systems is becoming prohibitive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And the distrust of representatives of the leadership of bureaucratic apparatuses towards each other is leading us to a crisis of living together on the planet. Which will be overcome through increasing the degree of control of actions by general centralized rules and regulations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Which will lead to the embodiment of the worst traits of those who will be at the head of centralized systems for managing the behavior and condition of the people under their control.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because there will be no systems and measures to contain the dark traits of human nature.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Which will break through into sexual and sadistic themes.
                    </p>               
                    <p>   
                        Is this a correct assessment? Or it's a dramatization of the situation?
                    </p> 
                    <br>                
                    <p>
                        But is there a risk of such a development?
                    </p>                 
                    <p>
                        And if we look at todayâ€™s world, at military conflicts, at confrontations of ideas, at sanctions policies dividing the world, then what are the reasons to believe that everything will be different?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        People have not learned to agree with each other on key issues in the rapidly developing field of artificial intelligence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And instead of dialogue about joint problems and solutions, they introduce export restrictions in the hope that this will change something.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But that's not so. <b>Sanctions are unable to restrain the growth of the military potential of global players.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And something needs to be done to ensure that sanctions are not needed at all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So that there is no basis for conflicting behaviors and strategies at the global level.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So that all subjects of world and national politics would be interested in a common, coordinated and balanced plan for global development and settlement of existing contradictions and needs from the point of view of interests.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        While the existing negotiation platforms are outdated and do not provide the opportunity to reach compromises on domestic and international problems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And people are deprived of the opportunity to act in concert so that everyone wins.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The world has changed thanks to communication and data analytics technologies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But the inertia of social systems is enormous, and the world is still within the framework of the zero-sum strategy and the concept of competition for survival.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While it seems that the only way to survive and improve life for everyone is through cooperation of interests and actions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And one of the problems of world relations is global capitalism as a way to resolve existing contradictions.
                    </p>                
                    <p>
                        The fact is that capitalism is fundamentally built on the collaboration of interests of enterprise participants and zero-sum confrontation with its competitors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And the world has become too small for global competition.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        And so we need to rethink the way we set rules and ways to live better and survive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We need a common denominator that would satisfy the needs of all participants in the global process, including ordinary citizens of all countries.
                    </p>           
                    <p>
                        And such a common denominator that leads us to well-being can only be survival for everyone and humanism as a value in relation to human life and human well-being.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And also a way that can ensure this common survival and prosperity.
                    </p>             
                    <p>
                        We must find a way to rethink individual and group development strategies so that we focus our attention and our efforts on how we can help other groups and countries solve the problems they face through our common, concerted global actions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And so we need a concept of shared well-being and ways of communicating that would increase trust in the common actions taken.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Such a concept could be the concept of general automation of economic life and the cessation of labor as a necessity for survival.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So that work remains only a voluntary activity in the interests of people, without reference to ensuring their basic level of survival: comfortable food, housing, clothing, energy, heat, transport, medicine. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This general concept would allow efforts to develop AI systems to be directed in a peaceful and mutually beneficial direction.
                    </p>     
                    <p>
                        Step by step moving towards this common prosperous future. Gradually migrating existing industrial solutions to a world where all production of goods and services is fundamentally automated and requires minimal human participation in accompanying the creation of goods and services associated with them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To gradually move towards an economy of sensations and benefits for development and improvement of people's condition. The degree of their awareness, self-control and the degree of their humanism and empathy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Developing the XR space as a means of leisure and work in an environment where work is no longer a necessary part of life to ensure survival.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        And for such joint actions, new channels of communication are needed between civil servants and heads of bureaucratic apparatuses.
                    </p>        
                    <p>
                        Which would allow us to quickly discuss and make decisions on issues of national and global politics. Acting cooperatively, jointly and in the common interest, taking into account the needs and constraints of each specific country.
                    </p>                   
                    <p>
                        To develop common media plans and military strategies that would meet the interests of all inhabitants of the planet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And the construction of such a common framework and such means of communication is the common goal and task of all humanistically oriented citizens of each state. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        And this is one of the few ways to avoid sliding into a world of constant wars and conflicts in an attempt to survive in a zero-sum strategy.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        A strategy whose path lies from the growth of chaos and confrontation to complete, total control as a way to combat chaos.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        And this tragic path to digital totalitarianization is now the guideline for managing complexity for vast numbers of people who may not even realize it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As well as where their inertial actions associated with the zero-sum paradigm lead.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        There is really nothing more to fight and conflict about. And the problem of current global conflicts and confrontations is the low level of trust and the inability to cope with the complexity of the tasks facing people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What we must change by identifying and implementing the key components of the complexity management system in a harmonious and prosperous world, free from the threat of digital totalitarianism.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To do this, we invite everyone to cooperate who is aware of this issue and is ready to take part in an amazing journey to transform the social and technological life of the planet.
                    </p>
